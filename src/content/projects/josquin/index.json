    "From July 13-16, 2022, the Pierre Boulez Saal Concert Hall in Berlin presented eight concerts, in which the Tallis Scholars Musical Ensemble performed 18 surviving masses of Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez (c. 1450-1521) in the first-ever cyclical presentation of these works. To promote the concerts, Neeeu designed and I developed a digital universe where audiences can explore the works of Josquin like never before."
