# Celebrating Josquin des Prez with a unique digital experience

From July 13–16, 2022, the Pierre Boulez Saal Concert Hall in Berlin presented eight concerts,  in which the Tallis Scholars Musical Ensemble and their founder and director Peter Phillips performed 18 surviving masses of Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez (c. 1450–1521) in the first-ever cyclical presentation of these works. To promote the concerts, Neeeu designed and I developed a digital universe where audiences can explore the works of Josquin like never before.
